                <p>I wanna be the very best
                    Like no one ever was
                    To catch them is my real test
                    To train them is my cause
                    I will travel across the land
                    Searching far and wide
                    Teach Pokemon to understand
                    The power that's inside
                    Pokemon!
                    Gotta catch 'em all--
                    It's you and me
                    I know it's my destiny
                    Pokemon!
                    Ooooh, you're my best friend
                    In a world we must defend
                    Pokemon!
                    Gotta catch 'em all--
                    Our hearts so true
                    Our courage will pull us through
                    You teach me and I'll teach you
                    Pokemon!
                    Gotta catch 'em all!
                    Gotta catch 'em all!
                    Yeeaa.
                    Every challenge along the way
                    With courage I can face
                    I will battle everyday
                    To claim my rightful place
                    Come with me the time is right
                    There's no better team
                    Arm in arm we'll win the fight
                    It's always been our dream
                    Pokemon!
                    Gotta catch 'em all--
                    It's you and me
                    I know it's my destiny
                    Pokemon!

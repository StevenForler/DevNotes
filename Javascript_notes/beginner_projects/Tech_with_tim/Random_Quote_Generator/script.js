//Set - unique collection of elements. usually notated with {} but JS doesn't have that kind of notation. no repeat values. This is great to use to know if something is in a set or not
// An array could be use but using a SET is a faster data structure in regards to if an element exists or not.

const usedIndexes = new Set() // to keep track of used quotes. to help not repeat already used quotes.
const quoteElement = document.getElementById("quote")

function generateQuote() {
    if (usedIndexes.size >= quotes.length) {
    //for Set you use size for an array you use length
    usedIndexes.clear()
    }

        const randomIdx = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)

        if(usedIndexes.has(randomIdx)) continue // this is to check if we've used a quote before. if hasn't been used continue.

        const quote = quotes[randomIdx]
        quoteElement.innerHTML = quote;
        usedIndexes.add(randomIdx)

    //math.random() helps generate a number between 0 and 1
    //math.floor() rounds down to the nearest number whole number
    // and the reason for doing this is because the quotes.length will have and index beyond what we can access
    //quotes.length this is to help count how many elements are inside of the "quotes"array

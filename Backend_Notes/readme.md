# BackEnd Project notes

This is where all of my backend notes will go. This readme will also update as my focus shifts with what I'm working on. 
as I'm working on getting familiar with these lanaguages for any potential roles in the future I will only have so much time to focus on these to a working level at a time.
the end goal is to eventually be at a point that I can troubleshoot server issues or set up issues in most of the languages I use the most consistently.

## Goal
My current focus is to familiarize myself with Javascript's way of setting up a backend server to a working level.
Eventually working my way through others languages.

## Frameworks
* Express.JS
* Rest.JS

Languages + frameworks to familiarize myself to a base understanding.

## languages + (frameworks)
* Golang (will need to research what )
* Python (Django, django-rest framework)
